		<h2>After The Bell - College Advanced programming research project</h2>
		<p>
		Role: Programmer, 3D artist <br> 
		Development duration: 3 months <br>
		Team size: Solo Project <br>
		Email for contact: bruno.barbosa8@yahoo.com <br>
		Link: https://dg015.itch.io/after-the-bell<br>
		</p>
		<!-- information about project starts here starts here-->
Afte the bell is a first person boxing game that uses a fighting system inspired by Kingdom's Come Delivarance combat system.

	<h3>Brainstorming</h3>
		<p>
			After the bell started as an idea after I impulse bought Kingdom Come Deliverace and ended up being too interested in the behind the scenes of the UI of the figthing system.
		</p>
		<p>
			In college we were able to pick what to work on for our advanced programing and I chose to remake the UI system in Unity, after finishing it I had some extra days to spare so I added animations that would trigger based on 	which direction the player chose to attack. I enjoyed the idea of the project so much that I decided to pick it up and continue to work on it.
		</p>
		<h3>Contributions</h3>
		<h4>Designer</h4>
		For this project everyone in the team took the role of game designer and we voted trough the decision to see what resonated with the team the most while trying to keep to the critique of social media apps. For this Project I helped design the mini games for each app and design an extra app that had to be scrapped due to time limitations.
		<h3>Junior programmer</h3>
		In this project I was in charge programing one of the mini games for the project. I chose to work on the emails mini game

		(GIF taken during the development of the mini game showcasing the basic functionality of email mini game)
		<p></p>
		In this project I had the opportunity to learn more about scriptable objects and how they function. All of the information in the emails were taken out of scriptable objects, this made me realize how inportant they are and how useful the can be. Now I realize how they can be used for a variety of things such as stats and attributes of enemies or players, settings for level parameters and the best use at Events.
		
		<h2>Learnings</h2>
		<h3>Game jam</h3>
		<h4>Programing</h4>
		<p>After my first successful game jam I learnt how game hams put your abilities to use.<br>
While I never saw myself a good programmer and thought that game jams wouldn't be the best way of developing my skills I was very wrong.<br>
Being able to learn from experienced programmers new tricks and receive feedback on my code from them was overall a good experiences </p>
		<h4>Scope</h4>
		This game jam showcased to me how the smallest systems can take so much work and time. This was especially proven to me on how simple our minigames ideas were we still struggled to fit any more then the minimum we agreed on due to how overarching system took so much time
		<h3>Using Learnt Knowledge</h3>
		 In this game jam one thing I was happy to be able to use is notes taken one of IGDA's talks in which developers from Lil guardsmen talked about what makes something funny. I was finally able to use the lesson thought by them in the narrative to create something fun and enjoyable
		<h2>Ending</h2>
		And with that To jam 2025 concludes, thank you for reading trough my devlog and feel free to reach out at: Bruno.barbosa8@yahoo.com for emails.
