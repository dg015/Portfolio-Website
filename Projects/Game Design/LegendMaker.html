	<h3>Development process</h3>
	  <p> The process started with the challenged to create a game based on a selection of pre chosen genres. The genre chosen was Dress up. As always we started by individually collecting as many references as we could about games related to For our brainstorming sessions we would do crazy 8s to generate ideas as fast as possible We as a team found often that the limited nature of the approach we decided to just work together and write our ideas on the board. Since our game was UI heavy we decided to every week bring out a interactable power point prototype, here's an interactable version of one of mine's </p>

<h3>Development process</h3>
After we finished the brainstorming phase we assigned each team member a main feature to manage and have more input over the decisions assigned to said feature. I was assigned the expedition system to take care off, and so I started working on the team as the lead system designer

One challenge we as a team discovered was how to make sure that the stats wouldn't make the dress up aspect unimportant. My proposed solution to said problem was adding special tags to locations, which would add new harmful events to those locations which could be mitigated by wearing outfits that match said location. After playtest this has proven to be useful as now players still express themselves and dress up to prepare to said locations, swapping outfits based on the requirements of the location.
	  <h3>Time as system designer</h3>
        <p> As the system designer I was in charge of creating balancing and creating the formulas behinds the systems in game, the chances of an event happening, item drop chance, how combats are played out, etc.. To help the team better visualize how my work would impact the group I re created the entirety of the current version of the game on excel allowing my team to run expeditions and create characters on excel in the span of seconds. While working on it I learned a lot about balancing and how to run simulations on excel using monte Carlo. While I did have problems learning excel I overcame them by studying excel on my free time and talking to professors for feedback. </p>
